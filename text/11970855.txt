The active involvement of physical exercise in the evolution of a variety of cancers is well documented .
However , its role in solid leukemia tumor development is essentially unknown .
Solid leukemia tumor cells were transplanted into 21 hybrid BDF1 control mice , exercise-trained mice that did not exercise during leukemia and exercise-trained mice that exercised during leukemia .
The tumor size of the continuously exercising group was of that of control and exercise-terminated animals 18 days after the transplantation .
The activity of antioxidant enzymes and the levels of lipid peroxidation and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine were not different in the tumors of the three groups .
The level of carbonylated proteins was smaller in tumors of continuously exercising animals .
The mutant form of cell regulatory protein p53 and vascular endothelial growth factor were present in similar amounts in the tumor cells of each group .
On the other hand , the protooncogene Ras and I-kappaB proteins were present in higher concentrations in tumors of continuously exercising rats .
The present data suggest that exercise during leukemia attenuates the development of tumors in mice .
The selective alteration of regulatory proteins might play a role in the beneficial effects of exercise during leukemia .
