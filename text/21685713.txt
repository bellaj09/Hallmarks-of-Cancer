Prenatal mortality is a prime concern for commercial swine industry in North America .
Fetal losses occur throughout gestation but cluster in early ( and mid ( pregnancy .
Adequate vascularization of the attachment site has emerged as a key factor contributing to fetal success .
Since Insulin-Like Growth Factor ( IGF ) family members regulate angiogenesis in addition to promoting fetal development and growth , we hypothesized that conceptus success is governed by members of the IGF family .
Using quantitative real time PCR , we analyzed expression of IGF family members ( IGF-I , IGF-II , IGF-I Receptor ( IGF-IR ) , IGF-IIR and their binding proteins , IGFBPs ) in matched maternal and fetal tissues of healthy and arresting conceptuses at gestation days ( gd ) 20 and 50 .
IGF-II transcripts were 100 fold increased in both maternal and fetal tissues compared to IGF-I , but receptor transcripts were found in similar abundance irrespective of health status and gestation point .
IGFBP3 was the most abundantly transcribed of the binding proteins .
Using immunohistochemistry we confirmed the expression of IGF family members in maternal luminal and glandular epithelial cells , the endothelium of blood vessels and some scattered stromal cells .
Our results suggest that IGF-I and II and their receptors are differentially expressed at the maternal and fetal components of the attachment site .
