Investigations toward the understanding of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) have been directed , so far , to the study of mechanisms leading to the disease .
We believe that understanding why of smokers evade COPD and how this evasion is accomplished might be a fruitful endeavour that could advance knowledge of the development of the disease .
Since the inflammatory infiltrate smokers develop seems to be the key element leading to the lung destruction in COPD , the understanding of the possible ways inflammation can be dampened , as well as its consequences , ought to be important .
We review here some of the mechanisms by which inflammation is controlled : by the post-translational regulons , by the mechanisms preventing full activation of dendritic cells and by the regulatory T-cells .
The potential role of the M2 alveolar macrophage phenotype and the newly described myeloid-derived suppressor cells is mentioned .
We also point out that evasion comes at a price , as healthy smokers might be immunosuppressed to some extent and unable to prevent the development of cancer , certainly less so than in severe COPD , where immunity is heightened .
Probably , the knowledge of the mechanisms of evasion from COPD could add significantly to the understanding of those leading to the disease .
