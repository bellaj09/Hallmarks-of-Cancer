Lanthanide(III) complexes [ Ln(pyphen)(acac)(2)(NO(3)) ] ( 1 , 2 ) , [ Ln(pydppz)(acac)(2)(NO(3)) ] ( 3 , 4 ) and [ La(pydppz)(anacac)(2)(NO(3)) ] ( 5 ) , where Ln is La(III) ( in 1 , 3 , 5 ) and Gd(III) ( in 2 , 4 ) , pyphen is 6-(2-pyridyl)-1,10-phenanthroline , pydppz is 6-(2-pyridyl)-dipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine , anacac is anthracenylacetylacetonate and acac is acetylacetonate , were prepared , characterized and their DNA photocleavage activity and photocytotoxicity studied .
The crystal structure of complex 2 displays a GdO(6)N(3) coordination .
The pydppz complexes 3-5 show an electronic spectral band at nm in DMF .
The La(III) complexes are diamagnetic , while the Gd(III) complexes are paramagnetic with seven unpaired electrons .
The molar conductivity data suggest 1 : 1 electrolytic nature of the complexes in aqueous DMF .
They are avid binders to calf thymus DNA giving K(b) in the range of 5.4 � 10(4)-1.2 � 10(6) M(-1) .
Complexes 3-5 efficiently cleave supercoiled DNA to its nicked circular form in UV-A light of 365 nm via formation of singlet oxygen ( (1)O(2) ) and hydroxyl radical ( HO˙ ) species .
Complexes 3-5 also exhibit significant photocytotoxic effect in HeLa cancer cells giving respective IC(50) value of 0.16(�0.01) , 0.15(�0.01) and 0.26�(0.02) μM in UV-A light of 365 nm , while they are less toxic in dark with an IC(50) value of >3 μM .
The presence of an additional pyridyl group makes the pydppz complexes more photocytotoxic than their dppz analogues .
FACS analysis of the HeLa cells treated with complex 4 shows apoptosis as the major pathway of cell death .
Nuclear localization of complex 5 having an anthracenyl moiety as a fluorophore is evidenced from the confocal microscopic studies .
