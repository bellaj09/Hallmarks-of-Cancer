Amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) altered metabolism , A\u03b2-overproduction/aggregation and oxidative stress are implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology .
Based on our previous data indicating that administration of a polyphenol-rich ( PrB ) blueberry extract ( from wild Vaccinium angustifolium ) is memory enhancing in healthy mice and in order to delineate the neuroprotective mechanisms , this study investigated the antioxidant effects of PrB in H\u2082O\u2082-induced oxidative damage , A\u03b2 peptide fibrillogenesis and APP metabolism .
PrB suppressed H\u2082O\u2082-initiated oxidation ( DCF assay ) and cell death ( MTT assay ) in SH-SY5Y cells .
Protective effects were observed on Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells overexpressing APP770 carrying the mutation Val717Phe only at high concentrations , while further damage on HEK293 cells was induced after co-treatment with 250 µM H\u2082O\u2082 and PrB in comparison with H\u2082O\u2082 alone .
Using the thioflavine T assay , blueberry polyphenols inhibited A\u03b2-aggregation ( 15 µg/mL ) in a time-dependent manner , while in the CHO(APP770) cells it had no effect on APP metabolism as assessed by western blot .
The results suggest that blueberry polyphenols exhibit antioxidant and/or pro-oxidant properties according to the cellular environment and have no effect on APP metabolism .
