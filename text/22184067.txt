Prostate apoptosis response 4 ( Par-4 ) is a ubiquitously expressed proapoptotic tumor suppressor protein .
Here , we show for the first time , that Par-4 is a novel substrate of caspase-3 during apoptosis .
We found that Par-4 is cleaved during cisplatin-induced apoptosis in human normal and cancer cell lines .
Par-4 cleavage generates a C-terminal fragment of kDa , and the cleavage of Par-4 is completely inhibited by a caspase-3 inhibitor , suggesting that caspase-3 is directly involved in the cleavage of Par-4 .
Caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells do not show Par-4 cleavage in response to cisplatin treatment , and restoration of caspase-3 in MCF-7 cells produces a decrease in Par-4 levels , with the appearance of a cleaved fragment .
Additionally , knockdown of Par-4 reduces caspase-3 activation and apoptosis induction .
Site-directed mutagenesis reveals that Par-4 cleavage by caspase-3 occurs at an unconventional site , EEPD(131)↓G .
Interestingly , overexpression of wild-type Par-4 but not the Par-4 D131A mutant sensitizes cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis .
Upon caspase-3 cleavage , the cleaved fragment of Par-4 accumulates in the nucleus and displays increased apoptotic activity .
Overexpression of the cleaved fragment of Par-4 inhibits IκBα phosphorylation and blocks NF-κB nuclear translocation .
We have identified a novel specific caspase-3 cleavage site in Par-4 , and the cleaved fragment of Par-4 retains proapoptotic activity .
