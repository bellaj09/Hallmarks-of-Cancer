Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB ) is a key signaling molecule in the elaboration of the inflammatory response .
Data indicate that curcumin , a natural ingredient of the curry spice turmeric , acts as a NF-κB inhibitor and exhibits both anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties .
Curcumin analogs with enhanced activity on NF-κB and other inflammatory signaling pathways have been developed including the synthetic monoketone compound 3,5-Bis(2-fluorobenzylidene)-4-piperidone ( EF24). 3,5-Bis(2-pyridinylmethylidene)-4-piperidone ( EF31 ) is a structurally-related curcumin analog whose potency for NF-κB inhibition has yet to be determined .
To examine the activity of EF31 compared to EF24 and curcumin , mouse RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with EF31 , EF24 , curcumin ( 1-100 μM ) or vehicle ( DMSO 1% ) for 1h .
NF-κB pathway activity was assessed following treatment with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( 1 μg/mL ) .
EF31 ( IC(50) μM ) exhibited significantly more potent inhibition of LPS-induced NF-κB DNA binding compared to both EF24 ( IC(50) μM ) and curcumin ( IC(50) >50 μM ) .
In addition , EF31 exhibited greater inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation as well as the induction of downstream inflammatory mediators including pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA and protein ( tumor necrosis factor-α , interleukin-1β , and interleukin-6 ) .
Regarding the mechanism of these effects on NF-κB , EF31 ( IC(50) μM ) exhibited significantly greater inhibition of IκB kinase β compared to EF24 ( IC(50) μM ) .
Finally , EF31 demonstrated potent toxicity in NF-κB-dependent cancer cell lines while having minimal and reversible toxicity in RAW264.7 macrophages .
These data indicate that EF31 is a more potent inhibitor of NF-κB activity than either EF24 or curcumin while exhibiting both anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities .
Thus , EF31 represents a promising curcumin analog for further therapeutic development .
