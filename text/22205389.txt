We describe a severe form of congenital myasthenic syndrome ( CMS ) caused by two heteroallelic mutations : a nonsense and a missense mutation in the gene encoding agrin ( AGRN ) .
The identified mutations , Q353X and V1727F , are located at the N-terminal and at the second laminin G-like ( LG2 ) domain of agrin , respectively .
A motor-point muscle biopsy demonstrated severe disruption of the architecture of the neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) , including : dispersion and fragmentation of endplate areas with normal expression of acetylcholinesterase ; simplification of postsynaptic membranes ; pronounced reduction of the axon terminal size ; widening of the primary synaptic cleft ; and , collection of membranous debris material in the primary synaptic cleft and in the subsynaptic cytoplasm .
Expression studies in heterologous cells revealed that the Q353X mutation abolished expression of full-length agrin .
Moreover , the V1727F mutation decreased agrin-induced clustering of the acetylcholine receptor ( AChR ) in cultured C2 muscle cells by >100-fold , and phosphorylation of the MuSK receptor and AChR beta subunit by Surprisingly , the V1727F mutant also displayed increased binding to \u03b1-dystroglycan but decreased binding to a neural ( z+ ) agrin-specific antibody .
Our findings demonstrate that agrin mutations can associate with a severe form of CMS and cause profound distortion of the architecture and function of the NMJ .
The impaired ability of V1727F agrin to activate MuSK and cluster AChRs , together with its increased affinity to \u03b1-dystroglycan , mimics non-neural ( z- ) agrin and are important determinants of the pathogenesis of the disease .
