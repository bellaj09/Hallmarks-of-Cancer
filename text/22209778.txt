Primary charge separation dynamics in the reaction center ( RC ) of purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides and its P870 heterodimer mutants have been studied using femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy with 20 and 40fs excitation at 870nm at 293K .
Absorbance increase in the 1060-1130nm region that is presumably attributed to P(A)(\u03b4+) cation radical molecule as a part of mixed state with a charge transfer character P*(P(A)(\u03b4+)P(B)(\u03b4-)) was found .
This state appears at 120-180fs time delay in the wild type RC and even faster in H(L173)L and H(M202)L heterodimer mutants and precedes electron transfer ( ET ) to B(A) bacteriochlorophyll with absorption band at 1020nm in WT .
The formation of the P(A)(\u03b4+)B(A)(\u03b4-) state is a result of the electron transfer from P*(P(A)(\u03b4+)P(B)(\u03b4-)) to the primary electron acceptor B(A) ( still mixed with P* ) with the apparent time delay of Next step of ET is accompanied by the 3-ps appearance of bacteriopheophytin a(-) ( H(A)(-) ) band at 960nm .
The study of the wave packet formation upon 20-fs illumination has shown that the vibration energy of the wave packet promotes reversible overcoming of an energy barrier between two potential energy surfaces P* and P*(P(A)(\u03b4+)B(A)(\u03b4-)) at For longer excitation pulses ( 40fs ) this promotion is absent and tunneling through an energy barrier takes about 3ps .
