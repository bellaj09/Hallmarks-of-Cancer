In aqueous media , photochemical excitation to S(1) of 3-phenylphenols 4-8 leads to deprotonation of the phenol OH , coupled with protonation of the benzyl alcohol and overall dehydration that delivers zwitterions 17-21 .
The zwitterions react with nucleophiles ( CH(3)OH , CF(3)CH(2)OH and ethanolamine ) converting them in high quantum yields to the corresponding adducts and photosolvolysis products ( for photomethanolysis \u03a6 Zwitterions 20 and 21 were characterized by laser flash photolysis in CH(3)CN-H(2)O ( \u03c4 and 25 \u03bcs , respectively ) and the associated quenching rate constants with nucleophiles azide and ethanolamine determined .
In vitro studies of antiproliferative activity of the photochemicaly generated QMs and zwitterions formed from 2- , 3- and 4-phenylphenols were carried out on three human cancer cell lines HCT 116 ( colon ) , MCF-7 ( breast ) , and H 460 ( lung ) .
Irradiation of cells incubated with 3 , 6 , and 26 showed enhanced antiproliferative activity compared to the cells that were not irradiated .
