The flavonoid naringin is a polyphenolic compound that naturally occurs in citrus .
Patients with cancer generally present features of malnutrition and cachexia .
Levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α ( TNF-α ) and interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) are raised in patients with cancer .
This study was designed to analyze the in vivo effect of naringin in the therapeutic treatment of rats bearing Walker 256 carcinosarcoma ( W256 ) .
Rats were treated intraperitoneally with different doses of naringin ( 10 , 25 and 35 mg/kg ) , for 50 days .
At 25 mg/kg , naringin inhibited tumor growth by With this treatment , TNF-α and IL-6 levels decreased ( p<0.05 ) in comparison with the control .
In addition , two rats presented complete tumor regression .
Inhibition of tumor growth , survival increase and the reduction of TNF-α and IL-6 levels in rats bearing W256 treated with naringin strongly suggest that this compound has potential as an anticarcinogenic drug .
