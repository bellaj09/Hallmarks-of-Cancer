The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of composite wound dressing films made of silk fibroin ( SF ) containing hydroxyapatite ( HA ) or polarized HA ( pHA ) powders on endothelial cell ( EC ) behaviors that have important roles in the wound-healing process .
XRD revealed the SF films to be semicrystalline , with a broad peak centered at about 20.7� which is characteristic of β-sheets embedded within an amorphous matrix .
The SF composite films with 0.6 ( w/v)% in concentration of HA powder ( HA/SF ) or pHA powder ( pHA/SF ) contained HA crystals of amorphous and silk II crystalline structures .
SEM observation showed that there were differences in SF morphology between HA/SF and pHA/SF .
The pHA/SF exhibited a furry texture around the pHA crystals , most likely due to the stored charged and zeta potentials .
The HA/SF and pHA/SF films enhanced EC migration compared with that on the SF film .
The number of migrated cells on the HA/SF and pHA/SF was times larger than that on the SF .
The quantitative analysis of the endothelial morphogenesis indicated that the pHA/SF film enhanced the formation of capillary-like structures compared with SF and HA/SF .
Thus , pHA/SF may potentially stimulate and contribute to the enhancement of angiogenesis in the wound-healing process .
