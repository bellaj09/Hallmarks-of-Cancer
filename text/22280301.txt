Covalent bonding interactions between the Lewis acid and Lewis base functionalities have been probed in a series of " frustrated Lewis pairs " ( FLPs ) ( mainly substituted vinylene linked intramolecular phosphane-borane adducts ) , using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques and accompanying DFT calculations .
Both the ( 11)B NMR isotropic chemical shifts and nuclear electric quadrupolar coupling parameters turn out to be extremely sensitive experimental probes for such interactions , revealing linear correlations with boron-phosphorus internuclear distances .
The principal component V(zz) of the ( 11)B electric field gradient tensor is tilted slightly away ( from the boron-phosphorus internuclear vector , leading to an improved understanding of the remarkable reactivity of the FLPs .
Complementary ( 31)P{(1)H}-CPMAS experiments reveal significant ( 31)P-(11)B scalar spin-spin interactions ( (1)J \u2248 50 Hz ) , evidencing covalent bonding interactions between the reaction centers .
Finally , ( 11)B{(31)P} rotational echo double resonance ( REDOR ) experiments show systematic deviations from calculated curves based on the internuclear distances from X-ray crystallography .
These deviations suggest non-zero contributions from anisotropic indirect spin-spin ( J anisotropy ) interactions , thereby offering additional evidence for covalent bonding .
