Chromosomal inversions are usually portrayed as simple two-breakpoint rearrangements changing gene order but not gene number or structure .
However , increasing evidence suggests that inversion breakpoints may often have a complex structure and entail gene duplications with potential functional consequences .
Here , we used a combination of different techniques to investigate the breakpoint structure and the functional consequences of a complex rearrangement fixed in Drosophila buzzatii and comprising two tandemly arranged inversions sharing the middle breakpoint : 2m and 2n .
By comparing the sequence in the breakpoint regions between D. buzzatii ( inverted chromosome ) and D. mojavensis ( noninverted chromosome ) , we corroborate the breakpoint reuse at the molecular level and infer that inversion 2m was associated with a duplication of a kb segment and likely generated by staggered breaks plus repair by nonhomologous end joining .
The duplicated segment contained the gene CG4673 , involved in nuclear transport , and its two nested genes CG5071 and CG5079 .
Interestingly , we found that other than the inversion and the associated duplication , both breakpoints suffered additional rearrangements , that is , the proximal breakpoint experienced a microinversion event associated at both ends with a 121-bp long duplication that contains a promoter .
As a consequence of all these different rearrangements , CG5079 has been lost from the genome , CG5071 is now a single copy nonnested gene , and CG4673 has a transcript kb shorter and seems to have acquired a more complex gene regulation .
Our results illustrate the complex effects of chromosomal rearrangements and highlight the need of complementing genomic approaches with detailed sequence-level and functional analyses of breakpoint regions if we are to fully understand genome structure , function , and evolutionary dynamics .
