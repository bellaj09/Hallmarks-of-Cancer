Doxorubicin ( DOX ) is one of the most powerful and widely prescribed chemotherapeutic agents to treat divergent human cancers .
However , the clinical use of DOX is restricted due to its severe cardiotoxic side-effects .
There has been ongoing search for cardioprotectants against DOX toxicity .
Inorganic nitrate has emerged as a bioactive compound that can be reduced into nitrite and nitric oxide in vivo and in turn plays a therapeutic role in diseases associated with nitric oxide insufficiency or dysregulation .
In this review , we describe a novel concept of using dietary supplementation of inorganic nitrate to reduce DOX-induced cardiac cellular damage and dysfunction , based on our recent promising studies in a mouse model of DOX cardiotoxicity .
Our data show that chronic oral ingestion of sodium nitrate , at a dose equivalent to of the Acceptable Daily Intake of the World Health Organization , alleviated DOX-induced left ventricular dysfunction and mitochondrial respiratory chain damage .
Such cardioprotective effects were associated with reduction of cardiomyocyte necrosis/apoptosis , tissue lipid peroxidation , and mitochondrial H(2)O(2) generation following DOX treatment .
Furthermore , proteomic studies revealed enhanced cardiac expression of mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme - peroxiredoxin 5 in the nitrate-treated animals .
These studies suggest that inorganic nitrate could be an inexpensive therapeutic agent for long-term oral administration in preventing DOX-induced cardiac toxicity and myopathy during the prolonged pathological process .
Future clinical trials in the cancer patients undergoing DOX chemotherapy are warranted to translate these experimental findings into an effective new therapy in preventing the DOX-induced cardiomyopathy .
