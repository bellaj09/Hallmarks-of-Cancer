The CO(2) laser has been used extensively in dermatological surgery over the past 30 years and is now recognised as the gold standard for soft tissue vaporization .
Considering that the continuous wave CO(2) laser delivery system and the newer " superpulsed " and scanned CO(2) systems have progressively changed our practice and patient satisfaction , a long range documentation can be useful .
Our experience has demonstrated that the use of CO(2) laser involves a reduced healing time , an infrequent need for anaesthesia , reduced thermal damage , less bleeding , less inflammation , the possibility of intra-operative histologic and/or cytologic examination , and easy access to anatomically difficult areas .
Immediate side effects have been pain , erythema , edema , typically see with older methods , using higher power .
The percentage of after-treatment keloids and hypertrophic scars observed was very low ( especially upon the usage of lower parameters .
The recurrence of viral lesions ( condylomas and warts ) have been not more frequent than those due to other techniques .
Tumor recurrence is minor compared with radiotherapy or surgery .
This method is a valid alternative to surgery and/or diathermocoagulation for microsurgery of soft tissues .
Our results are at times not consistent with those published in the literature , stressing the concept that multicentric studies that harmonization methodology and the patient selection are vital .
