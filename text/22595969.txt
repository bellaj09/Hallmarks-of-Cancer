Variable number tandem repeats ( VNTRs ) constitute a relatively under-examined class of genomic variants in the context of complex disease because of their sequence complexity and the challenges in assaying them .
Recent large-scale genome-wide copy number variant mapping and association efforts have highlighted the need for improved methodology for association studies using these complex polymorphisms .
Here we describe the in-depth investigation of a complex region on chromosome 8p21.2 encompassing the dedicator of cytokinesis 5 ( DOCK5 ) gene .
The region includes two VNTRs of complex sequence composition which flank a common 3975 bp deletion , all three of which were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction and fragment analysis in a total of 2744 subjects .
We have developed a novel VNTR association method named VNTRtest , suitable for association analysis of multi-allelic loci with binary and quantitative outcomes , and have used this approach to show significant association of the DOCK5 VNTRs with childhood and adult severe obesity ( P(empirical)= 8.9 × 10(-8) and P= 3.1 × 10(-3) , respectively ) which we estimate explains of the phenotypic variance .
We also identified an independent association between the 3975 base pair ( bp ) deletion and obesity , explaining a further 0.46% of the variance ( P(combined)= 1.6 × 10(-3) ) .
Evidence for association between DOCK5 transcript levels and the 3975 bp deletion ( P= 0.027 ) and both VNTRs ( P(empirical)= 0.015 ) was also identified in adipose tissue from a Swedish family sample , providing support for a functional effect of the DOCK5 deletion and VNTRs .
These findings highlight the potential role of DOCK5 in human obesity and illustrate a novel approach for analysis of the contribution of VNTRs to disease susceptibility through association studies .
