Double-strand DNA breaks are a serious threat to cellular viability and yeast systems have proved invaluable in helping to understand how these potentially toxic lesions are sensed and repaired .
An important method to study the processing of DNA breaks in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is to introduce a unique double-strand break into the genome by regulating the expression of the site-specific HO endonuclease with a galactose inducible promoter .
Variations of the HO site-specific DSB assay have been adapted to many organisms , but the methodology has seen only limited use in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe because of the lack of a promoter capable of inducing endonuclease expression on a relatively short time scale ( We have overcome this limitation by developing a new assay in which expression of the homing endonuclease I-PpoI is tightly regulated with a tetracycline-inducible promoter .
We show that induction of the I-PpoI endonuclease produces rapid cutting of a defined cleavage site ( > 80% after 1â€‰h ) , efficient cell cycle arrest and significant accumulation of the checkpoint protein Crb2 at break-adjacent regions in a manner that is analogous to published findings with DSBs produced by an acute exposure to ionizing irradiation .
This assay provides an important new tool for the fission yeast community and , because many aspects of mammalian chromatin organization have been well-conserved in Sz. pombe but not in S. cerevisiae , also offers an attractive system to decipher the role of chromatin structure in modulating the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks .
