Despite recent population data , the influence of dietary folate supplementation on colon cancer risk remains controversial .
This study examines the effects of folate deficiency , in combination with choline , methionine , and vitamin B12 depletion , on intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(Min/+) mice .
Methyl donor sufficient ( MDS ) and deficient ( MDD ) diets were started at five or 10 weeks of age and tumors evaluated at 16 weeks .
MDD suppressed intestinal tumor formation in Apc(Min/+) mice ( when started at five weeks of age .
The protective effect was lost when MDD was initiated at 10 weeks of age , indicating an important time dependency on cancer suppression .
Concomitant with cancer protection , MDD restricted body weight gain .
Therefore , a second study was conducted in which MDS was given ad libitum or pair-fed with MDD .
Although small intestinal tumors were reduced 54% in pair-fed MDS mice , MDD caused a further reduction ( 96% ) .
In colon , although MDD did not affect tumor numbers , tumor size was reduced .
Gene expression profiling of normal-appearing colonic mucosa after 11 weeks on MDD identified a total of 493 significantly downregulated genes relative to the MDS group .
Pathway analysis placed many of these genes within general categories of inflammatory signaling and cell-cycle regulation , consistent with recently published human data obtained during folate depletion .
Further studies are warranted to investigate the complex interplay of methyl donor status and cancer protection in high-risk populations .
