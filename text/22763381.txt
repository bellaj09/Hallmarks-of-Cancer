The 185delAG* BRCA1 mutation is encountered primarily in Jewish Ashkenazi and Iraqi individuals , and sporadically in non-Jews .
Previous studies estimated that this is a founder mutation in Jewish mutation carriers that arose before the dispersion of Jews in the Diaspora years ago .
The aim of this study was to assess the haplotype in ethnically diverse 185delAG* BRCA1 mutation carriers , and to estimate the age at which the mutation arose .
Ethnically diverse Jewish and non-Jewish 185delAG*BRCA1 mutation carriers and their relatives were genotyped using 15 microsatellite markers and three SNPs spanning 12.5\u2009MB , encompassing the BRCA1 gene locus .
Estimation of mutation age was based on a subset of 11 markers spanning a region of using a previously developed algorithm applying the maximum likelihood method .
Overall , 188 participants ( 154 carriers and 34 noncarriers ) from 115 families were included : Ashkenazi , Iraq , Kuchin-Indians , Syria , Turkey , Iran , Tunisia , Bulgaria , non-Jewish English , non-Jewish Malaysian , and Hispanics .
Haplotype analysis indicated that the 185delAG mutation arose 750-1500 years ago .
In Ashkenazim , it is a founder mutation that arose 61 generations ago , and with a small group of founder mutations was introduced into the Hispanic population ( conversos ) years ago , and into the Iraqi-Jewish community years ago .
The 185delAG mutation in the non-Jewish populations in Malaysia and the UK arose at least twice independently .
We conclude that the 185delAG* BRCA1 mutation resides on a common haplotype among Ashkenazi Jews , and arose about 61 generations ago and arose independently at least twice in non-Jews .
