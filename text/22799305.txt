OBJECTIVE To study the relationship between clinical pathologic characteristics , treatment modalities and prognostic factors in HER-2 ( Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor-2 ) overexpressed breast carcinoma .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Major clinico-pathological factors including therapeutic modalities and survival status of 371 breast cancer patients with HER2 over-expression , teated at Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital from March of 2002 to December of 2010 were retrospectively studied , with special attention focused on survival-related factors .
RESULTS The median age of the total 371 patients in this study was 48 years at time of diagnosis , among which , the leading pathological type was infiltrating ductal carcinoma ( 92.5% ) ; 62.8% presented with a primary tomor larger than 2 cm in diameter at diagnosis , 51.0% had axillary lymph node ( ALN ) metastases ; ER ( Estrogen receptor ) /PR ( Progesterone receptor ) double negative occured in 52.8% of cases , and PCNA ( proliferation cell nuclear antigen ) ( + + + ) was found in 55.1% .
HER-2 overexpressed patients were usually in advanced stage when the diagnosis was made ( 72.8% at stages IIA The prognosis and survival were assessed in 259 patients with complete follow-up data. 5-year DFS ( disease-free survival ) and OS ( overall survival ) rate was 68.0% and 78.0% respectively .
Univariate analysis revealed that age , tumor size , ALN metastases , LVSI ( lymph-vascular space involvement ) , PCNA status , hormonal therapy , chemotherapy cycles , and HER-2 overexpression , correlated closely with the prognosis .
ALN metastases , LVSI , PCNA status and chemotherapy cycles were independent predictors of survival .
CONCLUSIONS HER-2 overexpressed breast cancer has special clinical and pathological characteristics , with advanced clinical stages and high rate of ER/PR double negative .
Lymph node metastases , LVSI , PCNA and chemotherapy cycles are independent predictors of prognosis .
