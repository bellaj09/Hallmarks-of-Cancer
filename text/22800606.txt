Several lines of evidence indicate that neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) destruction and disassembly is an early phenomenon in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) .
Here we analyzed by confocal and electron microscopy the NMJ structure in the diaphragm of SOD1G93A mice at symptom onset .
In these mice , which provide a model for familial ALS , diaphragm denervation ( as well as gastrocnemius denervation ( was found .
In addition , the size of the synaptic vesicle pool was reduced and alterations of mitochondria were observed in approximately 40% of the remaining presynaptic terminals .
Chronic treatment of SOD1G93A mice with the anabolic steroid nandrolone during the presymptomatic stage preserved the diaphragm muscle mass and features indicative of synaptic activity .
These features were represented by the number of vesicles docked within 200 nm from the presynaptic membrane and area of acetylcholine receptor clusters .
Structural preservation of mitochondria was documented in presynaptic terminals .
However , innervation of diaphragm muscle fibers was only slightly increased in nandrolone-treated SOD1-mutant mice .
Altogether the results point out and define fine structural alterations of diaphragm NMJs in the murine model of familial ALS at symptom onset , and indicate that nandrolone may prevent or delay structural alterations in NMJ mitochondria and stimulate presynaptic activity but does not prevent muscle denervation during the disease .
