Mutations in mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) encoded nucleotide 8993 can cause NARP syndrome ( neuropathy , ataxia , and retinitis pigmentosa ) or MILS ( maternally inherited Leigh syndrome ) .
The rare T8993C mutation in the MT-ATP6 gene is generally considered to be clinically milder , but there is marked clinical heterogeneity ranging from asymptomatic carriers to fatal infantile Leigh syndrome .
Clinical heterogeneity has mostly been attributed to mtDNA heteroplasmy , but environmental , autosomal , tissue-specific factors , nuclear modifier genes , and mtDNA variations may also modulate disease expression .
Here , we report the results of whole mitochondrial genome analysis of a family with m.8993T>C mutation in the MT-ATP6 gene and associated with NARP/MILS , and discuss the familial inheritance , effects of variation in combinations and heteroplasmy levels on the clinical findings .
The whole mitochondrial genome was sequenced with average depth of coverage per sample with next-generation sequencing technology .
Thus , all heteroplasmic ( >%10 ) and homoplasmic variations were determined ( except for 727C insertion ) and classified according to the associations with mitochondrial diseases .
