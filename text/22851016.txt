The cellobiose- and cellulose-responsive induction of the FIII-avicelase ( cbhI ) , FII-carboxymethyl cellulase ( cmc2 ) , and FIa-xylanase ( xynIa ) genes is not regulated by XlnR in Aspergillus aculeatus , which suggests that this fungus possesses an unknown cellulase gene-activating pathway .
To identify the regulatory factors involved in this pathway , we constructed a random insertional mutagenesis library using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of A. aculeatus NCP2 , which harbors a transcriptional fusion between the cbhI promoter ( P ( CBHI ) ) and the orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase gene ( pyrG ) .
Of the transformants screened , one 5-FOA-resistant transformant , S4-22 , grew poorly on cellulose-containing media and exhibited reduced cellobiose-induced expression of cbhI .
Southern blot analysis and nucleotide sequencing of the flanking regions of the T-DNA inserted in S4-22 indicated that the T-DNA was inserted within the coding region of a previously unreported Zn(II)(2)Cys(6)-transcription factor , which we designated the cellobiose response regulator ( ClbR ) .
The disruption of the clbR gene resulted in a significant reduction in the expression of cbhI and cmc2 in response to cellobiose and cellulose .
Interestingly , the cellulose-responsive induction of FI-carboxymethyl cellulase ( cmc1 ) and FIb-xylanase ( xynIb ) genes that are under the control of XlnR , was also reduced in the clbR-deficient mutant , but there was no effect on the induction of these genes in response to D-xylose or L-arabinose .
These data demonstrate that ClbR participates in both XlnR-dependent and XlnR-independent cellobiose- and cellulose-responsive induction signaling pathways in A. aculeatus .
