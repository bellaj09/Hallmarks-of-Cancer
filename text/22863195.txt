Osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI ) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder associated with bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures after minimal trauma .
OI type V has an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance and is not caused by mutations in the type I collagen genes COL1A1 and COL1A2 .
The most remarkable and pathognomonic feature , observed in of affected individuals , is a predisposition to develop hyperplastic callus after fractures or surgical interventions .
To identify the molecular cause of OI type V , we performed whole-exome sequencing in a female with OI type V and her unaffected parents and searched for de novo mutations .
We found a heterozygous de novo mutation in the 5'-untranslated region of IFITM5 ( the gene encoding Interferon induced transmembrane protein 5 ) , 14 bp upstream of the annotated translation initiation codon ( c.-14C>T ) .
Subsequently , we identified an identical heterozygous de novo mutation in a second individual with OI type V by Sanger sequencing , thereby confirming that this is the causal mutation for the phenotype .
IFITM5 is a protein that is highly enriched in osteoblasts and has a putative function in bone formation and osteoblast maturation .
The mutation c.-14C>T introduces an upstream start codon that is in frame with the reference open-reading frame of IFITM5 and is embedded into a stronger Kozak consensus sequence for translation initiation than the annotated start codon .
In vitro , eukaryotic cells were able to recognize this start codon , and they used it instead of the reference translation initiation signal .
This suggests that five amino acids ( Met-Ala-Leu-Glu-Pro ) are added to the N terminus and alter IFITM5 function in individuals with the mutation .
