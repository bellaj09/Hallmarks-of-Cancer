Patients on hemodialysis ( HD ) who undergo lung resection represent a high risk group requiring a careful perioperative management .
To access a cardiac risk of HD patients a complete cardiac examination must be conducted preoperatively .
The patients should undergo sufficient courses of HD to ameliorate electrolyte imbalance and volume disturbance before surgery .
An elective operation should be scheduled on the day after HD .
During operation , gentle operative maneuver and complete hemostatic technique are required to reduce a risk of postoperative bleeding .
An adequate amount of antibiotics should be administrated to avoid a surgical site infection .
Pulmonary edema due to volume overload and hyperkalemia are the most dangerous postoperative complications .
Infusion should be conducted with potassium-free solution at 20 ml/h until the restart of HD .
HD could be safely performed with nafamostat mesilate on the day after operation in most patients .
If hyperkalemia and pulmonary edema are resistant to conservative managements , an emergency HD is required .
Prognosis after lung resection for lung cancer patients on HD is not satisfactory .
Many patients die of non cancer related causes such as heart failure and infection .
Long term management of the underlying renal condition is necessary to improve their postoperative survival .
