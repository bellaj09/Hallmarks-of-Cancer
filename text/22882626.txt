Plant lectins , carbohydrate-binding proteins of non-immune origin , have recently been reported to induce programmed cell death ( including apoptosis and autophagy ) in many types of cancer cells .
MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) , small , non-coding endogenous RNAs , nucleotides ( nt ) in length , have been well characterized to play essential roles in regulation of the autophagy process in cancer ; however , how these miRNAs regulate autophagic pathways in plant lectin-induced cancer cells , still remains an enigma .
