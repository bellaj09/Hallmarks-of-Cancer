The human asparaginase-like protein 1 ( hASRGL1 ) catalyzes the hydrolysis of l-asparagine and isoaspartyl-dipeptides .
As an N-terminal nucleophile ( Ntn ) hydrolase superfamily member , the active form of hASRGL1 is generated by an intramolecular cleavage step with Thr168 as the catalytic residue .
However , in vitro , autoprocessing is incomplete ( fettering the biophysical characterization of hASRGL1 .
We circumvented this obstacle by constructing a circularly permuted hASRGL1 that uncoupled the autoprocessing reaction , allowing us to kinetically and structurally characterize this enzyme and the precursor-like hASRGL1-Thr168Ala variant .
Crystallographic and biochemical evidence suggest an activation mechanism where a torsional restraint on the Thr168 side chain helps drive the intramolecular processing reaction .
Cleavage and formation of the active site releases the torsional restriction on Thr168 , which is facilitated by a small conserved Gly-rich loop near the active site that allows the conformational changes necessary for activation .
