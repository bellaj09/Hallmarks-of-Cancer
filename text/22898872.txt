Pathological features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) include , in addition to selective motor neuron ( MN ) degeneration , the occurrence of protein aggregates , mitochondrial dysfunction and astrogliosis .
SOD1 mutations cause rare familial forms of ALS and have provided the most widely studied animal models .
Relatively recent studies implicating another protein , TDP-43 , in familial and sporadic forms of ALS have led to the development of new animal models .
More recently , mutations in the valosin-containing protein ( VCP ) gene linked to the human genetic disease , Inclusion Body Myopathy associated with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia ( IBMPFD ) , were found also to be associated with ALS in some patients .
A heterozygous knock-in VCP mouse model of IBMPFD ( VCP(R155H/+) ) exhibited muscle , bone and brain pathology characteristic of the human disease .
We have undertaken studies of spinal cord pathology in VCP(R155H/+) mice and find age-dependent degeneration of ventral horn MNs , TDP-43-positive cytosolic inclusions , mitochondrial aggregation and progressive astrogliosis .
Aged animals ( months ) show electromyography evidence of denervation consistent with the observed MN loss .
Although these animals do not develop rapidly progressive fatal ALS-like disease during their lifespans , they recapitulate key pathological features of both human disease and other animal models of ALS , and may provide a valuable new model for studying events preceding onset of catastrophic disease .
