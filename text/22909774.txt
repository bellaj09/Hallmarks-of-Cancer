We report clinical findings that extend the phenotype of the kb 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome to include a rare , severe , and persistent pediatric speech sound disorder termed Childhood Apraxia of Speech ( CAS ) .
CAS is the speech disorder identified in a multigenerational pedigree ( 'KE' ) in which half of the members have a mutation in FOXP2 that co-segregates with CAS , oromotor apraxia , and low scores on a nonword repetition task .
Each of the two patients in the current report completed a 2-h assessment protocol that provided information on their cognitive , language , speech , oral mechanism , motor , and developmental histories and performance .
Their histories and standard scores on perceptual and acoustic speech tasks met clinical and research criteria for CAS .
Array comparative genomic hybridization analyses identified deletions at chromosome 16p11.2 in each patient .
These are the first reported cases with well-characterized CAS in the 16p11.2 syndrome literature and the first report of this microdeletion in CAS genetics research .
We discuss implications of findings for issues in both literatures .
