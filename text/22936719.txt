Innate immunity in corals is of special interest not only in the context of self-defense but also in relation to the establishment and collapse of their obligate symbiosis with dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium .
In innate immunity system of vertebrates , approximately 20 tripartite nucleotide oligomerization domain ( NOD)-like receptor proteins that are defined by the presence of a NAIP , CIIA , HET-E and TP1 ( NACHT ) domain , a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat ( LRR ) domain , and one of three types of N-terminal effector domain , are known to function as the primary intracellular pattern recognition molecules .
Surveying the coral genome revealed not only a larger number of NACHT- and related domain nucleotide-binding adaptor shared by APAF-1 , R proteins , and CED-4 ( NB-ARC)-encoding loci ( than in other metazoans but also surprising diversity of domain combinations among the coral NACHT/NB-ARC-containing proteins ; N-terminal effector domains included the apoptosis-related domains caspase recruitment domain ( CARD ) , death effector domain ( DED ) , and Death , and C-terminal repeat domains included LRRs , tetratricopeptide repeats , ankyrin repeats , and WD40 repeats .
Many of the predicted coral proteins that contain a NACHT/NB-ARC domain also contain a glycosyl transferase group 1 domain , a novel domain combination first found in metazoans .
Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the NACHT/NB-ARC domain inventories of various metazoan lineages , including corals , are largely products of lineage-specific expansions .
Many of the NACHT/NB-ARC loci are organized in pairs or triplets in the Acropora genome , suggesting that the large coral NACHT/NB-ARC repertoire has been generated at least in part by tandem duplication .
In addition , shuffling of N-terminal effector domains may have occurred after expansions of specific NACHT/NB-ARC-repeat domain types .
These results illustrate the extraordinary complexity of the innate immune repertoire of corals , which may in part reflect adaptive evolution to a symbiotic lifestyle in a uniquely complex and challenging environment .
