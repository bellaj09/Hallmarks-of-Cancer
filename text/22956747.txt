Leishmaniasis is one of the major tropical parasitic diseases , and the condition ranges in severity from self-healing cutaneous lesions to fatal visceral manifestations .
There is no vaccine available against visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) ( also known as kala-azar in India ) , and current antileishmanial drugs face major drawbacks , including drug resistance , variable efficacy , toxicity and parenteral administration .
We report here that n-hexane fractions of Artemisia annua leaves ( AAL ) and seeds ( AAS ) possess significant antileishmanial activity against Leishmania donovani promastigotes , with GI(50) of 14.4 and 14.6 µg ml(-1) , respectively , and the IC(50) against intracellular amastigotes was found to be 6.6 and 5.05 µg ml(-1) , respectively .
Changes in the morphology of promastigotes and growth reversibility analysis following treatment confirmed the leishmanicidal effect of the active fractions , which presented no cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells .
The antileishmanial activity was mediated via apoptosis , as evidenced by externalization of phosphatidylserine , in situ labelling of DNA fragments by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling ( TUNEL ) and cell-cycle arrest at the sub-G(0)/G(1) phase .
High-performance thin-layer chromatography ( HPTLC ) fingerprinting showed that the content of artemisinin in crude bioactive extracts ( µg per 100 µg n-hexane fraction ) was too low to account for the observed antileishmanial activity .
Characterization of the active constituents by GC-MS showed that \u03b1-amyrinyl acetate , \u03b2-amyrine and derivatives of artemisinin were the major constituents in AAL and cetin , EINECS 211-126-2 and artemisinin derivatives in AAS .
Our findings indicate the presence of antileishmanial compounds besides artemisinin in the n-hexane fractions of A. annua leaves and seeds .
