The effect of acute intense intermittent exercise compared with moderate-intensity exercise on angiogenic factors and the effect of 4 weeks of intense intermittent training on capillary growth were examined in nine healthy young men , preconditioned by moderate-intensity endurance training .
The intense training consisted of 24 bouts of 1 min cycling at an initial work rate of 316 Â± 19 W ( of pretraining maximal oxygen uptake ) , performed three times per week .
Skeletal muscle biopsies and muscle microdialysates were obtained from the vastus lateralis before , during and after acute exercise performed at either moderate or high intensity .
Comparison of the response in angiogenic factors to acute moderate- versus high-intensity exercise , performed prior to the intense training intervention , revealed that intense exercise resulted in a markedly lower ( P < 0.05 ) increase in interstitial vascular endothelial growth factor than did moderate-intensity exercise .
Muscle interstitial fluid obtained during moderate-intensity exercise increased endothelial cell proliferation in vitro more than interstitial fluid obtained during intense exercise ( sixfold versus 2.5-fold , respectively ; P < 0.05 ) .
The 4 weeks of high-intensity training did not lead to an increased capillarization in the muscle but abolished the exercise-induced increase in mRNA for several angiogenic factors , increased the protein levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase , lowered the protein levels of thrombospondin-1 in muscle but increased the interstitial protein levels of thrombospondin-1 .
We conclude that intense intermittent exercise provides a weak stimulus for vascular endothelial growth factor secretion and endothelial cell proliferation and that intense intermittent training does not induce a sufficient angiogenic stimulus to induce capillary growth in muscle previously conditioned by moderate-intensity exercise .
