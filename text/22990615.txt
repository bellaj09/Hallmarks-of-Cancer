Some people consume chronically glutamine ( GLN ) in high quantities ( g/d ) , although a number of biochemical pathways and cellular functions may be negatively affected .
The following side effects of GLN supplementation are discussed : ( 1 ) Alterations in amino acid transport-as GLN shares the transporters with other amino acids , enhanced GLN intake may impair amino acid distribution among tissues and their absorption in the gut and kidneys .
( 2 ) Alterations in GLN metabolism-GLN supplementation may impair synthesis of endogenous GLN and enhance glutamate and ammonia production .
( 3 ) Alterations in ammonia transport-GLN supplementation may impair ammonia detoxification and negatively affect the role of GLN as the carrier of ammonia among tissues .
( 4 ) Abnormalities in aminoacidemia-increased plasma levels of GLN , glutamate , citrulline , ornithine , arginine , and histidine and decreased levels of valine , leucine , isoleucine , glycine , threonine , serine , and proline are reported .
( 5 ) Alterations in immune system-as GLN has immunomodulating properties , the effect of chronic GLN consumption on the immune system needs to be assessed .
( 6 ) Effect on tumor growth-it should be elucidated whether chronic intake of GLN increases the risk of cancer .
( 7 ) Effect of the withdrawal of GLN supplementation-due to the adaptive response of the organism to enhanced GLN consumption , the withdrawal of GLN may enhance the risk of health problems resulting from GLN deficiency .
It is concluded that enhanced intake of GLN has substantial side effects , and long-term studies should be performed to justify chronic consumption of a GLN-enriched diet .
