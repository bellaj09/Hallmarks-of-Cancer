MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are 19 nt non-coding RNA molecules that regulate expression of target genes at the post-transcriptional level .
Evidence indicates that miRNAs play an essential role in physiological and pathological conditions including pulmonary development , inflammation , fibrosis and cancer .
The aim of the present study is to investigate the altered miRNAs expression profile in rats with experimental silicosis .
We duplicated silicosis rat model , and identify the miRNA expression pattern of silicosis rat with miRNA microarray .
Compared with normal lung tissue , fourteen miRNAs were found significantly up-regulated while the other twenty-five down-regulated in silicosis samples .
The differential expression of two selected miRNAs was confirmed by stem-loop real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction .
Our results indicate that the 39 altered miRNAs may be involved in lung fibrosis of rats that were exposed to silica dust .
Furthermore , the microarray results provide a solid basis for further validation , such as identification of other miRNAs that may be related to inflammation and fibrosis .
The findings are paving way for silicosis early prevention , prognosis and possible therapy .
