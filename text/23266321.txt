Although some types of carbon nanotubes ( CNTs ) have been described to induce mesothelioma in rodents and genotoxic effects in various cell systems , there are few previous studies on the genotoxicity of CNTs in mesothelial cells .
Here , we examined in vitro DNA damage induction by short multi-wall CNTs ( MWCNTs ; 10-30 nm × 1-2 \u03bcm ) and single-wall CNTs ( SWCNTs ; >50% SWCNTs , other CNTs ; <2 nm × 1-5 \u03bcm ) in human mesothelial ( MeT-5A ) cells and bronchial epithelial ( BEAS 2B ) cells , using the single cell gel electrophoresis ( comet ) assay and the immunoslot blot assay for the detection of malondialdehyde ( M1dG ) DNA adducts .
In BEAS 2B cells , we also studied the induction of micronuclei ( MN ) by the CNTs using the cytokinesis-block method .
The cells were exposed to the CNTs ( 5-200 \u03bcg/cm(2) , corresponding to 19-760 \u03bcg/ml ) for 24 and 48h in the comet assay and for 48 and 72 h in the MN and M1dG assays .
Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) showed more MWCNT fibres and SWCNT clusters in BEAS 2B than MeT-5A cells , but no significant differences were seen in intracellular dose expressed as area of SWCNT clusters between TEM sections of the cell lines .
In MeT-5A cells , both CNTs caused a dose-dependent induction of DNA damage ( % DNA in comet tail ) in the 48-h treatment and SWCNTs additionally in the 24-h treatment , with a statistically significant increase at 40 \u03bcg/cm(2) of SWCNTs and ( after 48 h ) 80 \u03bcg/cm(2) of both CNTs .
SWCNTs also elevated the level of M1dG DNA adducts at 1 , 5 , 10 and 40 \u03bcg/cm(2) after the 48-h treatment , but both CNTs decreased M1dG adduct level at several doses after the 72-h treatment .
In BEAS 2B cells , SWCNTs induced a statistically significant increase in DNA damage at 80 and 120 \u03bcg/cm(2) after the 24-h treatment and in M1dG adduct level at 5 \u03bcg/cm(2) after 48 h and 10 and 40 \u03bcg/cm(2) after 72 h ; MWCNTs did not affect the level of DNA damage but produced a decrease in M1dG adducts in the 72-h treatment .
The CNTs did not affect the level of MN .
In conclusion , MWCNTs and SWCNTs induced DNA damage in MeT-5A cells but showed a lower ( SWCNTs ) or no ( MWCNTs ) effect in BEAS 2B cells , suggesting that MeT-5A cells were more sensitive to the DNA-damaging effect of CNTs than BEAS 2B cells , despite the fact that more CNT fibres or clusters were seen in BEAS 2B than MeT-5A cells .
M1dG DNA adducts were induced by SWCNTs but decreased after a 3-day exposure to MWCNTs and ( in MeT-5A cells ) SWCNTs , indicating that CNTs may lead to alterations in oxidative effects within the cells .
Neither of the CNTs was able to produce chromosomal damage ( MN ) .
